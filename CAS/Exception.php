/**
 * A root exception interface for all exceptions in phpCAS.
 *
 * All exceptions thrown in phpCAS should implement this interface to allow them
 * to be caught as a category by clients. Each phpCAS exception should extend
 * an appropriate SPL exception class that best fits its type.
 *
 * For example, an InvalidArgumentException in phpCAS should be defined as
 *
 *		class CAS_InvalidArgumentException
 *			extends InvalidArgumentException
 *			implements CAS_Exception
 *		{ }
 *
 * This definition allows the CAS_InvalidArgumentException to be caught as either
 * an InvalidArgumentException or as a CAS_Exception.
